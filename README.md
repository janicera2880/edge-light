## Description 

As a Content Administrator for Oil And Energy company, I have gained knowledge in setting up requests, material sourcing, and some E-commerce background.  It prompted me to create a catalog website for my first project and choose home improvement lighting fixtures as my product because I have a passion for interior design.  I want to showcase an interactive website and entice my customer to purchase my product and help them decide on cohesive lighting choices for their homes or businesses.
