## Description 

As a Content Administrator for Oil And Energy company, I have gained knowledge in setting up requests, material sourcing, and some E-commerce background.  It prompted me to create a catalog website for my first project and choose home improvement lighting fixtures as my product because I have a passion for interior design.  I want to showcase an interactive website and entice my customer to purchase my product and help them decide on cohesive lighting choices for their homes or businesses.

## Installation 

To install this project, simply type this URL to your browser https://github.com/janicera2880/edge-light. Fork and clone by typing in command git clone on your terminal and then copy and paste the SSH code.  Once successful go ahead and change directory with command cd making sure it's to the correct folder.


## Usage 

To get started with the installation of the JSON server, if you have not done so.  All you need to do is to type in your terminal the following command:

> npm install -g json-server

After you have successfully done this step, you will then proceed to run the command through the terminal:

> json server --watch db.json

Now, to open the default file to your browser do the following command:

> _open index.html_ for MAC users and _explorer.exe index.html_ for WSL

The web application will then take you to the website where you can browse our unique and custom-made lighting fixtures.  You can either add them to your favorite list or add them to your cart.  Otherwise, stay up to date by subscribing to our latest events by simply providing us with your email address.
